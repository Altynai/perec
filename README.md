# Perec

Perec is an evolving modification of the [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/giulivo/pelican-svbhack) theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). It was built on the fly and is still rather rough in some areas.

While you are welcome to look at my mess. This probably production ready.

## DEMO Site

You can view the theme on [Text and Hubris](http://www.textandhubris.com/).
